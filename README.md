A sophisticated Python-based bot designed to identify arbitrage betting opportunities (surebets) across multiple sports and eSports in real-time. This tool automates the process of scanning, calculating, and notifying users of profitable betting scenarios.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Multi-Provider Architecture**: Built with a flexible, pluggable provider system. Easily integrate multiple odds APIs to maximize market coverage. Currently configured for:
    *   **TheOddsAPI** for traditional sports.
    *   **A dedicated slot for a new eSports API** (see Roadmap).
*   **Advanced Calculation Engine**: The core logic is not just a simple comparison. It intelligently handles:
    *   **2-Way Markets**: For sports like Tennis and eSports (e.g., Winner 1 vs. Winner 2).
    *   **3-Way Markets**: For sports like Soccer, correctly factoring in the Draw (Home, Draw, Away).
    *   **Complex Markets**: Differentiates between different betting lines for `Totals` (Over/Under 2.5, 3.5, etc.) and `Spreads` to avoid false positives.
*   **Real-time Telegram Alerts**: Delivers instant, beautifully formatted notifications via Telegram the moment a surebet is detected, providing all the necessary information to act quickly.
*   **Robust & Resilient**: Designed with comprehensive error handling. The bot is resilient to API downtime or unexpected data formats, ensuring continuous operation.
*   **Automated Scheduling**: Features a "set-it-and-forget-it" automated mode that runs scans at user-defined intervals.
*   **Dedicated Test Suite**: Includes a `test_runner.py` file to validate the core logic, test provider integrations, and debug API responses, ensuring system reliability.

## üí° How It Works

The bot operates on a clean, orchestrated workflow:

1.  **Scheduler**: The `scheduler.py` script acts as the entry point, triggering the main task at a configured interval or for a single run.
2.  **Main Orchestrator (`main.py`)**: Initializes and loops through all active data providers.
3.  **Data Providers**: Each provider (`the_odds_api_provider.py`, etc.) is responsible for fetching raw data from its specific API.
4.  **Data Consolidation**: The main orchestrator gathers the structured `Game` objects from all providers into a single, unified list.
5.  **SureBet Calculator**: This powerful module iterates through every game and market, applying the correct mathematical formula to identify arbitrage opportunities.
6.  **Notifier**: If a profitable surebet is found, the `notifier.py` module formats a detailed message and sends it via the Telegram Bot API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Python 3.10+
*   **Core Libraries**:
    *   `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the odds APIs.
    *   `schedule`: For elegant and simple task automation.

## üîß Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the bot up and running.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SurebetProject.git
cd SurebetProject

```
**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
*   **Windows**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
*   **macOS / Linux**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

**3. Install Dependencies**
This project's dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Configure the Bot**
Rename the example configuration file `config.py.example` to `config.py` and fill in your details.
```bash
# In the terminal
mv config.py.example config.py
```

Now, open `config.py` and edit the following variables:
```python
# --- API Keys ---
# Get your key from https://the-odds-api.com/
THE_ODDS_API_KEY = "YOUR_THE_ODDS_API_KEY"

# Placeholder for the new eSports API key
ESPORTS_API_KEY = "YOUR_NEW_ESPORTS_API_KEY" 

# --- Telegram Configuration ---
# Your bot's token from BotFather
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" 
# Your personal or group chat ID
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"

# --- Automation Settings ---
# Set to True to enable automated runs, False for a single manual run.
AUTOMATION_ENABLED = False
# Interval in minutes between each scan when automation is enabled.
RUN_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 60
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot

The bot can be run in two modes, controlled by the `AUTOMATION_ENABLED` flag in `config.py`.

*   **Manual Mode** (`AUTOMATION_ENABLED = False`): The bot will run a single, complete scan and then exit. This is ideal for testing.
    ```bash
    python scheduler.py
    ```

*   **Automated Mode** (`AUTOMATION_ENABLED = True`): The bot will run an initial scan and then continue to run in the background, triggering a new scan at the interval defined by `RUN_INTERVAL_MINUTES`.
    ```bash
    python scheduler.py
    ```
    For long-term running on a server, consider using a process manager like `systemd` or `supervisor`, or a simple tool like `nohup`:
    ```bash
    nohup python scheduler.py &
    ```

## üß™ Running Tests

The project includes a dedicated test runner to validate functionality without affecting the main application.
```bash
python test_runner.py
```

You can edit this file to enable or disable specific tests for debugging providers or the calculation logic.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This project is under active development. Future plans include:

*   **[Top Priority]** Integrate a New eSports API: Research and integrate a high-quality odds aggregator for eSports (CS2, LoL, Valorant) to achieve full market coverage.
*   **Expand Market Coverage**: Add support for more complex bet types (e.g., Asian Handicaps, Player Props).
*   **Historical Data Analysis**: Store found surebets in a database to analyze trends and bookmaker accuracy over time.
*   **Web Dashboard**: Develop a simple web interface to view bot status and historical findings.
